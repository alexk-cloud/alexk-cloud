## 👋 Hello, I'm Alex Ko! 
I'm a second year Computer Science student at University of the Pacific with a passion for creating practical, real-world solutions that help people live their daily lives.
Most of my experience is in C++, with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, but I'm highly adaptable and willing to learn new things to create the best solutions I can.
But just because I like making practical solutions doesn't mean that I don't like making projects for fun! Game development is another one of my interests, and is something I want to
explore down the line.

## ⚡ Skills
- C++
- Java
- Python

## 📚 What I'm Currently Learning
I'm currently learning Java application development at UOP. In my free time, I'm also learning Python with an emphasis on APIs and AI/Machine Learning, and a little bit of Godot Game
Engine development.

## 🔭 What I'm Looking to Work On
Right now, I'm looking to work on more Python projects that involve AI and/or Machine Learning, either for making tools for people to use, or data analysis.

## 🤔 What I'm Open To
I'm open to collaborating on any new projects that involve hands-on learning and experience.
